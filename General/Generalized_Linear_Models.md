**Logistic Regression**, despite its name, is a linear model for classification rather than regression. Logistic regression is also known in the literature as logit regression, maximum-entropy classification (MaxEnt) or the log-linear classifier. In this model, the probabilities describing the possible outcomes of a single trial are modeled using a logistic function.

**Linear Regression** is a method for modelling a relationship between a dependent variable and independent variables. These models can be fit with numerous approaches. The most common is **least squares**, where we minimize the mean square error between the predicted values $\hat{y} = \textbf{X}\hat{\beta}$ and actual values $y$: $\left(y-\textbf{X}\beta\right)^{2}$.

We can also define the problem in probabilistic terms as a generalized linear model (GLM) where the pdf is a Gaussian distribution, and then perform maximum likelihood estimation to estimate $\hat{\beta}$.
